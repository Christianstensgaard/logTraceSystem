## StreamWriter.cs & StreamReader.cs has been created:

  - This includes more simple visualization of how the Slave will handle the request.

  > [!NOTE]
  > devnote_ working on the TraceController, the enable of the tracing and logging should be done in the program.cs instead right now it is done inside the functionController class.
